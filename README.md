## 🚀 Tech Stack
- ⚙️ **YOLOv8-X Segmentation** – High-accuracy image segmentation  
- ⚡ **FastAPI** – Backend API for model prediction  
- 🎨 **Streamlit** – Interactive frontend UI  
- 🐳 **Docker** + **Docker Compose** – Easy containerization & service orchestration  
- ☁️ **ECS** – Cloud deployment and testing
- 🪣	 **OSS** – To upload Model to OOS then download it on ecs on root fold  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
My goal was to learn and experiment with:
- Deploying real segmentation models using **AWS EC2 + Docker**
- Building full-stack AI apps (backend + frontend)
- Using Docker Compose to coordinate services
- Validating deployment on cloud environments (AWS)

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This project was successfully deployed and tested on an **AWS EC2 instance** using Docker Compose.  
Although the instance was temporary (~30 mins 😅), it confirmed the project’s cloud readiness and real-world functionality.

> ✅ FastAPI and Streamlit both worked smoothly over the public IP.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
To get the best predictions:
- 📸 Upload **only one date fruit per image**
- ☁️ Use a **clean and plain background** (preferably white)
- 🚫 Avoid distractions (cups, hands, etc.)
- 💡 Ensure good lighting

---

## 📷 Supported Classes
- `Sokari`  
- `Sugaey`  
- `Ajwa`  
- `Medjool`

## 🔗 Model File

⬇️ Download the trained model and place it in the root as:  
`date_fruit_model.pt`
